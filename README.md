<h1> Colon cancer cells segmentation

# Aim
The aim of this technical project is to design, implement and test an image informatics approach for automatic colon cancer cells segmentation in microscopy imagery using image informatics methods/techniques covered in the Image Informatics (CSC8628) moduleâ€™s lectures and practicals only. To assess the accuracy and the quality of the cells (nuclei and cytoplasm) segmentation approach, we compare the nuclei and cytoplasm segmentation results with the golden standard manual nuclei and cytoplasm segmentation results, using Jaccard Score metric.


The 4 jupyter notebooks contain all the exploratory work done under this technical project.

The "Project thresh.ipynb and Project km.ipynb" are exploratory notebooks where the different transformations and segmented techniques were initially explored.

The "Project cyt.ipynb" is the jupyter notebook containing the code comparing the performance of different image processing and segmentation techniques on the cytoplasm images.

The "Project nuc.ipynb" is the jupyter notebook containing the code comparing the performance of different image processing and segmentation techniques on the nuclei images.
